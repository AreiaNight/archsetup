### INSTALL

```
git clone https://github.com/AreiaNight/archsetup.git
cd archsetup
chmod +x autoArch.sh 
./autoArch.sh

```
And that's it! You'll need to singout and login to see the changes. This script will automatically install and copy everything in the dots.

### WM

For now the only avalible one is bspwm, but you can install awesome in its basic core and you'll get all the dotifiles to use freely.

### EXTRAS

As I'm a pentester, I implimented a hacking tool section. This will install al my personal and most used tools with some extras. As well, if you are interested in just this part of my workspace, I have another [script](https://github.com/AreiaNight/my_tools.git) that will install the tools but in 3 different version for you to choose. It's for arch and debian distros!
