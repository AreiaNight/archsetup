# AREIA'S WORKSPACE

<!-- INFORMATION -->

### Areia's Temple is here!

Thanks for come in! This is my currently envirioment for work. This time I was inspired by sainnhe's color pallete and I wanted to make something with that vibe. 
So, after weeks, finally I share with you this! 

If you have any issue, let me know and I'll work to fix it.

### EXTRAS

As I'm a pentester, I implimented a hacking tool section. This will install al my personal and most used tools with some extras. As well, if you are interested in just this part of my workspace, I have another [script](https://github.com/AreiaNight/my_tools.git) that will install the tools but in 3 different version for you to choose. It's for arch and debian distros!
